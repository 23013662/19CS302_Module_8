# EX 39 C program to find sum of digits.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C program to find sum of digits.

## Algorithm
1. Start. 
2. Define a variables. 
3. Write a program to print the sum and difference of the integers.. 
4. Read the value using scanf. 
5. Ask the user to make an input. 
6. Print out the answer. 
7. End.

## Program:
```

#include <stdio.h> 
 
int main() { 
    int a, b; 
    int sum, difference; 
 
    // Input two numbers 
    printf("Enter two 
integers: "); 
    scanf("%d %d", &a, 
&b); 
 
    // Calculate sum and 
difference 
    sum = a + b; 
    difference = a - b; 
 
    // Print the results 
    printf("Sum = 
%d\n", sum); 
    printf("Difference = 
%d\n", difference); 
 
    return 0; 
} 
```

## Output:
